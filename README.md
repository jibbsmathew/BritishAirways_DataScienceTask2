# British Airways Data Science Task

## Task Description

Welcome to the British Airways Data Science Task! In this task, you will explore and prepare a dataset to predict whether a customer will make a booking. The goal is to train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance, providing insights into the variables contributing to the model's predictive power.

## Getting Started

To begin, explore the dataset using the provided "Getting Started" Jupyter Notebook available in the Resources section. Familiarize yourself with the dataset's columns and basic statistics. This initial exploration will lay the foundation for your subsequent tasks.

## Dataset Preparation

Once you have a good understanding of the dataset, consider how to prepare it for predictive modeling. Think about creating new features that can enhance your model's performance. Utilize the provided resources to guide you through this phase and ensure the dataset is ready for training.

## Machine Learning Model

Train a machine learning model to predict the target outcome â€“ whether a customer will make a booking. Choose an algorithm that facilitates the extraction of information about each variable's contribution to the model's predictive power. RandomForest is recommended for this purpose.

## Model Evaluation and Presentation

After training your model, evaluate its performance using cross-validation and appropriate metrics. Create visualizations to interpret how each variable contributes to the model. Provide clear and insightful findings in your presentation.

## Tools and Recommendations

- It is recommended to perform the analysis using Python.
- Make use of the resources provided to guide you through the dataset exploration and preparation.
- Consider using RandomForest or a similar algorithm to facilitate variable importance interpretation.
